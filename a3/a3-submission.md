## What are the slider names for the space you picked?

There are many slider names: "Chaos", "Age", "Gender", "Width", "Height", "Yaw", "Pitch", "Asian", "White", "Indian", "Black", "Middle Eastern", "Latino-Hispanic", "Art", "Red", "Green", "Blue", "Hue", "Saturation", "Brightness", "Sharpness", "Happy", "Angry", "Blue Eyes", "Earrings", "Eyes Open", "Mouth Open", "Black Hair", "Blonde Hair", "Brown Hair", "Makeup", "Glasses", "Facial Hair", and "Hat".

## What is the dimensionality of this space?

For 34 sliders, we have a 34 dimensional cube of 34 dimensionality.

## Which two sliders are you exploring?

I chose the "Hat" and "Latino-Hispanic" sliders.

## Is this space smooth? Where did things suddenly change?
The space is relatively smooth until the sliders get to a range that makes the art very abstract.

For the Latino-Hispanic slider, the artwork became much more abstract above 1.178 or below -1.12 with the artwork resembling less and less of a portrait.

For the Hat slider, the artwork became more and more like blobs below -0.37.
