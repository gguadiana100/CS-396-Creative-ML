# A6: Tracery-to-voice
Create a tracery grammar with Artbot.club.  Generate some text.   

* Read [the US Copyright Fair Use guidelines](https://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/fair-use).
* Create a tracery grammar
* Generate some samples of text from it
* Use [the RealTimeVoiceCloning colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tugstugi/dl-colab-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/RealTimeVoiceCloning.ipynb) to convert this text into an audio clip.
	*  You can use either your own voice, or use an audio-scraping tool to get a voice sample from a youtube video, or use an MP3 of an audio book or podcast.
	*  E.g: create a generator for new Critical Role scenarios, or David Attenborough nature descriptions, or use your own voice to narrate new poetry
*  Download the audio file from the colab, and save the grammar as a plaintext file, and submit both those and this .md to Canvas


## Name

Gilberto Guadiana

## What does your Tracery grammar generate?
My grammar generates text that Dr. Jordan B. Peterson may say during a lecture on the psychology of religion.

## What is working well about the grammar?
Considering a single instance, the grammar does a good job of mixing in phrases that Dr. Peterson may use.

## What didn't work about the grammar?
The output created from this grammar is very similar to each other. There is a lack of variety in the output although most of the output gets close to the intended purpose.

## Did any output surprise you?
I was surprised at how the voice sample that was generated was of a higher pitch than that of the ebook.

## What voice sample did you use?
I used Chapter 10 from the Ender's Game eBook that I found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbTuKXryM6M&ab_channel=H.M.Friendly.

## If you used anything other than your own voice, what parts of the Fair Use doctrine suggest that this is ok to use?
The output is so transformative and for educational, non-profit purposes while not being competitive to the original work that this would likely fall under fair use.

## How would the original owner of the voice feel about this generated sample?
The original owner would likely be amused that their voice was used to render text that is similar to what Dr. Jordan B. Peterson may say during a lecture on the psychology of religion.

## How did your perception of the text change when it was voice?
The voice made me think of how an eBook on Dr. Peterson's life may sound like. It sounded a lot less like him and a lot more like what might come in an autobiography or a memoir.

The following Tracery tutorial was quite helpful in identifying the syntax for grammars.
